"""Traditional Chinese support, by way of the simplified script.

There is no such thing as a "traditional Chinese voice" to add. A voice is a speaker's
timbre; the script a book is printed in is a property of the *text*, and it is handled
before the model ever sees it, in the grapheme-to-phoneme front end. Kokoro's Chinese front
end (misaki[zh]) is jieba for word segmentation plus pypinyin for readings, and both of
those dictionaries are keyed on simplified characters. Feed them traditional text and they
mostly limp along character by character, which costs exactly the two things the phrase
dictionaries were there to provide:

- **Polyphone disambiguation.** 乾乾淨淨 is read `qián qián jìng jìng` rather than
  `gān gān jìng jìng`, because 乾 collapses two different simplified characters (干 and 乾)
  and the phrase that would settle which one is meant is not in the dictionary. The worst
  offender is the aspect particle 著 (她笑著說), read `zhù` rather than the neutral-tone
  `zhe` -- and that one turns up in nearly every paragraph of a novel.
- **Word segmentation.** 臺灣的 segments as 臺 / 灣的 and 個人罷了 as 個 / 人罷 / 了, so the
  tone sandhi and the pauses land in the wrong places.

Converting to simplified before phonemization fixes both, and costs nothing in fidelity:
Mandarin pronunciation does not depend on which script the sentence was written in. The
audio you get is what a Mandarin reader would say when reading the traditional page aloud.

The conversion applies to the narration path only. Titles, chapter marks and everything
else written into the .m4b keep the book's original characters.

    """Let jieba load its dictionary on setuptools 81-83. Returns True if it patched.

    jieba reads its dictionary through `pkg_resources.resource_stream`, behind a bare
    `except ImportError`. setuptools 81 removed `resource_stream` while keeping the
    `pkg_resources` module, so the import succeeds and the *call* raises AttributeError --
    which that guard does not catch, and jieba dies on the first word it segments. Since
    misaki[zh] segments with jieba, that takes every Chinese book down with it.

    The window is narrow in both directions, which is what makes this easy to miss:
    setuptools < 81 still has the function, and >= 84 drops `pkg_resources` altogether so
    the guard fires and jieba's own file-open fallback works. jieba's last release was
    2020, so there is no fixed version to require.

    Worse, jieba caches its parsed dictionary in a temp file and only calls the loader on a
    cache miss, so a developer machine with a warm `jieba.cache` passes while a fresh CI
    runner fails on the same code -- which is exactly how this reached CI unnoticed.

    Called on import, because jieba initializes lazily on first use and misaki reaches it
    without passing back through this module.
