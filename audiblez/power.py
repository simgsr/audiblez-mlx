"""Keep the machine awake for the length of a run.

Synthesising a full-length novel takes hours -- a 16-chapter Chinese book runs from
mid-afternoon into the night -- and for most of that time nobody is touching the keyboard.
An idle laptop suspends, the TTS loop and the final ffmpeg pass stop with it, and what
should have finished overnight is found half-done in the morning.

So for the duration of main() we hold the platform's "don't idle-sleep" assertion and drop
it as soon as the .m4b is written. Three things this deliberately does *not* do:

- keep the *display* awake. The screen may as well go dark; only the system suspending hurts.
- override a closed lid. Clamshell sleep is not something an assertion can veto, on any
  of these platforms.
- fail the run. A machine that will not hold the lock still converts books, it just needs
  to not be left alone, so an unavailable lock is a printed warning and nothing more.
