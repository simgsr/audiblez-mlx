"""TTS backends.

Kokoro runs through torch (portable, works everywhere, now the default engine) or through
MLX (Apple Silicon only, measured ~3.8x faster on an M5 Max but historically linked to
kernel panics on some machines). Both produce the same voices from the same weights, so
the choice is purely about speed and platform.

The MLX pipeline is adapted to Kokoro's own call signature, so `gen_audio_segments` --
and everything downstream of it -- does not need to know which engine is running.
