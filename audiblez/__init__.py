# The package used to append its own directory to sys.path so that `from core import main`
# resolved. That made audiblez's modules importable under bare top-level names such as
# `core`, `ui` and `backends`, where they could shadow unrelated modules. The imports are
# fully qualified now, so the path hack is gone.
